  <p id ="bob">The Universe wants you and me to have an abundant life, and it is always supporting us in making this a reality.

However, we must do our part. To create the life we desire, we must live in harmony with Universal Laws, such as thinking from the inside out.

You see, all creation starts on the inside. That includes the things and experiences that show in our lives. We create our life circumstances in our mind, in our imagination, before they become our reality.

However, most people either don’t understand this, or they simply don’t use it to their advantage. Instead of thinking about what they want until it reshapes their future, they focus on their current circumstances, such as the amount of money in their bank account. As a result, the amount of money in their account doesn’t change much.

    Even though that’s a common mistake, here’s how you can correct it quickly.</p>
